# 7 - Client App with Webpack

## Structure of our app

- Create a `dist` folder at the root of your project, and add the following `index.html` file to it:

```html
<!doctype html>
<html>
  <head>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div class="app"></div>
    <script src="client-bundle.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

In your `src` folder, create the following subfolders: `server`, `shared`, `client`, and move your current `index.js` into `server`, and `dog.js` into `shared`. Create `app.js` in `client`.

We are not going to do any Node back-end yet, but this separation will help you see more clearly where things belong. You'll need to change the `import Dog from './dog';` in `server/index.js` to `import Dog from '../shared/dog';` though, or ESLint will detect errors for unresolved modules.

Write this in `client/app.js`:

```javascript
import Dog from '../shared/dog';

const browserToby = new Dog('Browser Toby');

document.querySelector('.app').innerText = browserToby.bark();
```

Add the following to your `package.json`, under `eslintConfig`:

```json
"env": {
  "browser": true
}
```
This way we can use variables such as `window` or `document` which are always accessible in the browser without ESLint complaining about undeclared variables.

If you want to use some of the most recent ES features in your client code, like `Promise`s, you need to include the [Babel Polyfill](https://babeljs.io/docs/usage/polyfill/) in your client code.

- Run `yarn add babel-polyfill`

And before anything else in `app.js`, add this import:

```javascript
import 'babel-polyfill';
```

Including the polyfill adds some weight to your bundle, so add it only if you use the features it covers. In order to provide some solid boilerplate code with this tutorial, I am including it and it will appear in code samples in the next chapters.

## Webpack

In a Node environment, you can freely `import` different files and Node will resolve these files using your filesystem. In a browser, there is no filesystem, and therefore your `import`s point to nowhere. In order for our entry point file `app.js` to retrieve the tree of imports it needs, we are going to "bundle" that entire tree of dependencies into one file. Webpack is a tool that does this.

Webpack uses a config file, just like Gulp, called `webpack.config.js`. It is possible to use ES6 imports and exports in it, in the exact same way that we made Gulp rely on Babel to do so: by naming this file `webpack.config.babel.js`.

- Create an empty `webpack.config.babel.js` file

- While you're at it, add `webpack.config.babel.js` to your Gulp `lint` task, and a few more `paths` constants:

```javascript
const paths = {
  allSrcJs: 'src/**/*.js',
  gulpFile: 'gulpfile.babel.js',
  webpackFile: 'webpack.config.babel.js',
  libDir: 'lib',
  distDir: 'dist',
};

// [...]

gulp.task('lint', () =>
  gulp.src([
    paths.allSrcJs,
    paths.gulpFile,
    paths.webpackFile,
  ])
    .pipe(eslint())
    .pipe(eslint.format())
    .pipe(eslint.failAfterError())
);
```

We need to teach Webpack how to process ES6 files via Babel (just like we taught Gulp how to process ES6 files with `gulp-babel`). In Webpack, when you need to process files that are not plain old JavaScript, you use *loaders*. So let's install the Babel loader for Webpack:

- Run `yarn add --dev babel-loader`

- Write the following to your `webpack.config.babel.js` file:

```javascript
export default {
  output: {
    filename: 'client-bundle.js',
  },
  devtool: 'source-map',
  module: {
    loaders: [
      {
        test: /\.jsx?$/,
        loader: 'babel-loader',
        exclude: [/node_modules/],
      },
    ],
  },
  resolve: {
    extensions: ['', '.js', '.jsx'],
  },
};
```

Let's analyze this a bit:

We need this file to `export` stuff for Webpack to read. `output.filename` is the name of the bundle we want to generate. `devtool: 'source-map'` will enable source maps for a better debugging experience in your browser. In `module.loaders`, we have a `test`, which is the JavaScript regex that will be used to test which files should be processed by the `babel-loader`. Since we will use both `.js` files and `.jsx` files (for React) in the next chapters, we have the following regex: `/\.jsx?$/`. The `node_modules` folder is excluded because there is no transpilation to do there. This way, when your code `import`s packages located in `node_modules`, Babel doesn't bother processing those files, which reduces build time. The `resolve` part is to tell Webpack what kind of file we want to be able to `import` in our code using extension-less paths like `import Foo from './foo'` where `foo` could be `foo.js` or `foo.jsx` for instance.

Okay so now we have Webpack set up, but we still need a way to *run* it.

## Integrating Webpack to Gulp

Webpack can do a lot of things. It can actually replace Gulp entirely if your project is mostly client-side. Gulp being a more general tool, it is better suited for things like linting, tests, and back-end tasks though. It is also simpler to understand for newcomers than a complex Webpack config. We have a pretty solid Gulp setup and workflow here, so integrating Webpack to our Gulp build is going to be easy peasy.

Let's create the Gulp task to run Webpack. Open your `gulpfile.babel.js`.

We don't need the `main` task to execute `node lib/` anymore, since we will open `index.html` to run our app.

- Remove `import { exec } from 'child_process'`.

Similarly to Gulp plugins, the `webpack-stream` package lets us integrate Webpack into Gulp very easily.

- Install the package with: `yarn add --dev webpack-stream`

- Add the following `import`s:

```javascript
import webpack from 'webpack-stream';
import webpackConfig from './webpack.config.babel';
```

The second line just grabs our config file.

Like I said earlier, in the next chapter we are going to use `.jsx` files (on the client, and even on the server later on), so let's set that up right now to have a bit of a head start.

- Change the constants to the following:

```javascript
const paths = {
  allSrcJs: 'src/**/*.js?(x)',
  serverSrcJs: 'src/server/**/*.js?(x)',
  sharedSrcJs: 'src/shared/**/*.js?(x)',
  clientEntryPoint: 'src/client/app.js',
  gulpFile: 'gulpfile.babel.js',
  webpackFile: 'webpack.config.babel.js',
  libDir: 'lib',
  distDir: 'dist',
};
```

The `.js?(x)` is just a pattern to match `.js` or `.jsx` files.

We now have constants for the different parts of our application, and an entry point file.

- Modify the `main` task like so:

```javascript
gulp.task('main', ['lint', 'clean'], () =>
  gulp.src(paths.clientEntryPoint)
    .pipe(webpack(webpackConfig))
    .pipe(gulp.dest(paths.distDir))
);
```

**Note**: Our `build` task currently transpiles ES6 code to ES5 for every `.js` file located under `src`. Now that we've split our code into `server`, `shared`, and `client` code, we could make this task only compile `server` and `shared` (since Webpack takes care of `client`). However, in the Testing chapter, we are going to need Gulp to also compile the `client` code to test it outside of Webpack. So until you reach that chapter, there is a bit of useless duplicated build being done. I'm sure we can all agree that it's fine for now. We actually aren't even going to be using the `build` task and `lib` folder anymore until that chapter, since all we care about right now is the client bundle.

- Run `yarn start`, you should now see Webpack building your `client-bundle.js` file. Opening `index.html` in your browser should display "Wah wah, I am Browser Toby".

One last thing: unlike our `lib` folder, the `dist/client-bundle.js` and `dist/client-bundle.js.map` files are not being cleaned up by our `clean` task before each build.

- Add `clientBundle: 'dist/client-bundle.js?(.map)'` to our `paths` configuration, and tweak the `clean` task like so:

```javascript
gulp.task('clean', () => del([
  paths.libDir,
  paths.clientBundle,
]));
```

- Add `/dist/client-bundle.js*` to your `.gitignore` file:
