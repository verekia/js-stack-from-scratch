# 8 - React

We're now going to render our app using React.

First, let's install React and ReactDOM:

- Run `yarn add react react-dom`

These 2 packages go to our `"dependencies"` and not `"devDependencies"` because unlike build tools, the client bundle needs them in production.

Let's rename our `src/client/app.js` file into `src/client/app.jsx` and write some React and JSX code in it:

```javascript
import 'babel-polyfill';

import React, { PropTypes } from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import Dog from '../shared/dog';

const dogBark = new Dog('Browser Toby').bark();

const App = props => (
  <div>
    The dog says: {props.message}
  </div>
);

App.propTypes = {
  message: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
};

ReactDOM.render(<App message={dogBark} />, document.querySelector('.app'));
```

**Note**: If you are unfamiliar with React or its PropTypes, learn about React first and come back to this tutorial later. There is going to be quite some React things in the upcoming chapters, so you need a good understanding of it.

In your Gulpfile, change the value of `clientEntryPoint` to give it a `.jsx` extension:

```javascript
clientEntryPoint: 'src/client/app.jsx',
```

Since we use the JSX syntax here, we have to tell Babel that it needs to transform it as well.
Install the React Babel preset, which will teach Babel how to process the JSX syntax:
`yarn add --dev babel-preset-react` and change the `babel` entry in your `package.json` file like so:

```json
"babel": {
  "presets": [
    "latest",
    "react"
  ]
},
```

Now after running `yarn start`, if we open `index.html`, we should see "The dog says: Wah wah, I am Browser Toby" rendered by React.
