# 10 - Immutable JS and Redux Improvements

## Immutable JS

Unlike the previous chapter, this one is rather easy, and consists in minor improvements.

First, we are going to add **Immutable JS** to our codebase. Immutable is a library to manipulate objects without mutating them. Instead of doing:

```javascript
const obj = { a: 1 };
obj.a = 2; // Mutates `obj`
```
You would do:
```javascript
const obj = Immutable.Map({ a: 1 });
obj.set('a', 2); // Returns a new object without mutating `obj`
```

This approach follows the **functional programming** paradigm, which works really well with Redux. Your reducer functions actually *have* to be pure functions that don't alter the state passed as parameter, but return a brand new state object instead. Let's use Immutable to enforce this.

- Run `yarn add immutable`

We are going to use `Map` in our codebase, but ESLint and the Airbnb config will complain about using a capitalized name without it being a class. Add the following to your `package.json` under `eslintConfig`:

```json
"rules": {
  "new-cap": [
    2,
    {
      "capIsNewExceptions": [
        "Map",
        "List"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
This makes `Map` and `List` (the 2 Immutable objects you'll use all the time) exceptions to that ESLint rule. This verbose JSON formatting is actually done automatically by Yarn/NPM, so we cannot make it more compact unfortunately.

Anyway, back to Immutable:

In `dog-reducer.js` tweak your file so it looks like this:

```javascript
import Immutable from 'immutable';
import { MAKE_BARK } from '../actions/dog-actions';

const initialState = Immutable.Map({
  hasBarked: false,
});

const dogReducer = (state = initialState, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case MAKE_BARK:
      return state.set('hasBarked', action.payload);
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

export default dogReducer;
```

The initial state is now built using an Immutable Map, and the new state is generated using `set()`, preventing any mutation of the previous state.

In `containers/bark-message.js`, update the `mapStateToProps` function to use `.get('hasBarked')` instead of `.hasBarked`:

```javascript
const mapStateToProps = state => ({
  message: state.dog.get('hasBarked') ? 'The dog barked' : 'The dog did not bark',
});
```

The app should still behave exactly the way it did before.

**Note**: If Babel complains about Immutable exceeding 100KB, add `"compact": false` to your `package.json` under `babel`.

As you can see from the code snippet above, our state object still contains a plain old `dog` object attribute, which isn't immutable. It is fine this way, but if you want to only manipulate immutable objects, you could install the `redux-immutable` package to replace Redux's `combineReducers` function.

**Optional**:
- Run `yarn add redux-immutable`
- Replace your `combineReducers` function in `app.jsx` to use the one imported from `redux-immutable` instead.
- In `bark-message.js` replace `state.dog.get('hasBarked')` by `state.getIn(['dog', 'hasBarked'])`.

## Redux Actions

As you add more and more actions to your app, you will find yourself writing quite a lot of the same boilerplate. The `redux-actions` package helps reducing that boilerplate code. With `redux-actions` you can rewrite your `dog-actions.js` file in a more compact way:

```javascript
import { createAction } from 'redux-actions';

export const MAKE_BARK = 'MAKE_BARK';
export const makeBark = createAction(MAKE_BARK, () => true);
```

`redux-actions` implement the [Flux Standard Action](https://github.com/acdlite/flux-standard-action) model, just like the action we previously wrote, so integrating `redux-actions` is seamless if you follow this model.

- Don't forget to run `yarn add redux-actions`.
