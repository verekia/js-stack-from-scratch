Welcome to my modern JavaScript stack tutorial: **JavaScript Stack from Scratch**.

This is a minimalistic and straight-to-the-point guide to assembling a JavaScript stack. It requires some general programming knowledge, and JavaScript basics. **It focuses on wiring tools together** and giving you the **simplest possible example** for each tool. You can see this tutorial as *a way to write your own boilerplate from scratch*.

You don't need to use this entire stack if you build a simple web page with a few JS interactions of course (a combination of Browserify/Webpack + Babel + jQuery is enough to be able to write ES6 code in different files with CLI compilation), but if you want to build a web app that scales, and need help setting things up, this tutorial will work great for you.

Since the goal of this tutorial is to assemble various tools, I do not go into details about how these tools work individually. Refer to their documentation or find other tutorials if you want to acquire deeper knowledge in them.

A big chunk of the stack described in this tutorial uses React. If you are beginning and just want to learn React, [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) will get you up and running with a React environment very quickly with a premade configuration. I would for instance recommend this approach to someone who arrives in a team that's using React and needs to catch up with a learning playground. In this tutorial you won't use a premade configuration, because I want you to understand everything that's happening under the hood.

Code examples are available for each chapter, and you can run them all with `yarn && yarn start` or `npm install && npm start`. I recommend writing everything from scratch yourself by following the **step-by-step instructions** of each chapter.

**Every chapter contains the code of previous chapters**, so if you are simply looking for a boilerplate project containing everything, just clone the last chapter and you're good to go.

Note: The order of chapters is not necessarily the most educational. For instance, testing / type checking could have been done before introducing React. It is quite difficult to move chapters around or edit past ones, since I need to apply those changes to every following chapter. If things settle down, I might reorganize the whole thing in a better way.

The code of this tutorial works on Linux, macOS, and Windows.
