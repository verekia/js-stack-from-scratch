Welcome to my modern JavaScript stack tutorial: **JavaScript Stack from Scratch**.

This is a minimalistic and straight to the point guide to assembling a JavaScript stack. It teaches you how to set up **ES6, Babel, Gulp, ESLint, React, Redux, Webpack, Immutable, Mocha, Chai, Sinon, and Flow**. It requires some general programming knowledge, and JavaScript basics. **It focuses on wiring all these tools together** and giving you the **simplest possible example** for each tool. You can see this tutorial as *a way to write your own boilerplate from scratch*.

Since the goal of this tutorial is to assemble various tools, I do not go into details about how these tools work individually. Refer to their documentation or find other tutorials if you want to acquire deeper knowledge in them.

A big chunk of the stack described in this tutorial uses React. A lot of React tutorials completely skip the setup part, which makes newcomers build their learning on weak foundations. Instead of giving beginners a "black box" configuration, the approach I'm taking here is to set up the foundations in the simplest possible way, for a thorough understanding.

Code examples are available for each chapter, and you can run them all with `yarn && yarn start` or `npm install && npm start`. I recommend writing everything from scratch yourself by following the **step-by-step instructions** of each chapter.

**Every chapter contains the code of previous chapters**, so if you are simply looking for a boilerplate project containing everything, just clone the last chapter and you're good to go.

Note: The order of chapters is not necessarily the most educational. For instance, testing / type checking could have been done before introducing React. It is quite difficult to move chapters around or edit past ones, since I need to apply those changes to every following chapter. If things settle down, I might reorganize the whole thing in a better way.

The code of this tutorial works on Linux, macOS, and Windows.
